# Simple Codes To Make My Life A Little Bit Easier
In this repo I'll be adding simple but handy programs that I wrote to make my life a little bit easier. None of these codes are written to work most efficiently, but they are written in the shortest possible time to barely do the task in hand. 

Below I'll be adding a little description about these programs. And I'll try to keep my codes as readable as possible.

***1. Maximum Possible Nagad Cashout Amount.py***

This is a very handy program for me. Every month when my father sends money in my Nagad Account I have to calculate it by hand. So I spent 5 minutes writing this code to make the process easier for me. 
In the future, if I feel like it, I'll try to automate the whole process by reading my SMS texts from Nagad.
